# W_SpotDetection3D-BigFISH

This workflow detects spots in a 3D image by using the fishquant2/BigFISH software. BigFISH applies a LoG-filter and detects the maxima above a threshold. BigFISH can auto-detect the threshold value and remove detections that are likely to be double detections of the same spot.
